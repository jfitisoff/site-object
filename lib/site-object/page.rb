# Page objects are containers for all of the functionality of a page that you want to expose for testing
# purposes. When you create a page object you define a URL to access it, elements for all of the page
# elements that you want to work with as well as higher level methods that use those elements to perform
# page operations.
#
# Here's a very simple account edit page example that has two fields and one button and assumes
# that you've defined a site object called 'ExampleSite.'
#
#  class AccountDetailsEditPage < ExampleSite::Page
#    set_url "/accounts/{account_code}/edit" # Parameterized URL.
#
#    element(:first_name)   {|b| b.text_field(:id, 'fname') } # text_field is a Watir method.
#    element(:last_name)    {|b| b.text_field(:id, 'fname') } # text_field is a Watir method.
#    element(:save)         {|b| b.button(:id, 'fname') }     # text_field is a Watir method.
#
#    def update(fname, lname) # Very simple method that uses the page elements defined above.
#      first_name.set fname
#      last_name.set  lname
#      save.click
#    end
#  end
#
# The URL defined in the example above is "parameterized" ({account_code} is a placeholder.)
# You don't need to specify parameters for a URL, but if you do you need to call the page with a hash
# argument. To use the page after initializing an instance of the site object:
#
#  site.account_details_edit_page(account_code: 12345)
#
# Pages only take arguments if the URL is parameterized.
#
# Note that in the example above that there's no explicit navigation call. This is because the site will
#look at its current URL and automatically navigate to the page if it's not already on it.
#
# Here's a simple page object for the rubygems.org search page. Note that no page URL is
# defined using the PageObject#set_url method. This is because the page URL for the landing page is
# the same as the base URL for the site. When a page URL isn't explicitly defined the base URL is used
# in its place:
#
#  class LandingPage < RubyGems::Page
#    element(:search_field)  { |b| b.browser.text_field(:id, 'home_query') }
#    element(:search_submit) { |b| b.browser.input(:id, 'search_submit')   }
#
#    def search(criteria)
#      search_field.set('rails')
#      search_submit.click
#      expect_page(SearchResultsPage)
#    end
#  end
#
# Page objects aren't initialized outside of the context of a site object. When a site object is initialized
# it creates accessor methods for each page object that inherits from the site's page class. In the
# example above, the LandingPage class inherits from the RubyGems site object's page class so you'd
# be able to use it once you've initialized a RubyGems site:
#
#  site.landing_page.search("rails") # Returns an instance of the landing page after performing a search.
#
# Because the site object has accessor methods for all of its pages and page navigation is automatic
# it's not always necessary to specify a page object directly. But you can get one if need one:
#
#  page = site.some_page
#  =><SomePage>
module PageObject

  module PageClassMethods
    cattr_accessor :page_features # Page features should be inheritable so that page templates work.
    attr_reader    :page_attributes, :page_elements, :page_url, :url_template, :url_matcher

    # DEPRECATED. Use the set_attributes method instead.
    # This method can be used to disable page navigation when defining a page class (it sets an
    # instance variable called @navigation during initialization.) The use case for this is a page
    # that can't be accessed directly and requires some level of browser interaction to reach.
    # To disable navigation:
    #
    #  class SomePage < SomeSite::Page
    #    disable_automatic_navigation true
    #  end
    #
    # When navigation is disabled there will be no automatic navigation when the page is called.
    # If the current page is not the page that you want a SiteObject::WrongPageError will
    # be raised.
    # If the visit method is called on the page a SiteObject::PageNavigationNotAllowedError
    # will be raised.
    def disable_automatic_navigation
      puts "The disable_automatic_navigation method is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the set_attributes method in place of this one in the class definition. See documentation for more details."

    # Used to define access to a single HTML element on a page. This method takes two arguments:
    # * A symbol representing the element you are defining. This symbol is used to create an accessor
    #   method on the page object.
    # * A block where access to the HTML element gets defined.
    #
    # Example: The page you are working with has a "First Name" field:
    #
    #  element(:first_name) { |b| b.text_field(:id 'signup-first-name') }
    #
    # In the example above,  the block argument 'b' is the browser object that will get passed down from
    # the site to the page and used when the page needs to access the element. You can actually use any
    # label for the block argument but it's recommended that you use something like 'b' or 'browser'
    # consistently here because it's always going to be some sort of browser object.
    #
    # When page objects get initialized they'll create an accessor method for the element and you can
    # then work with the element in the same way you'd work with it in Watir or Selenium.
    #
    # The element method is aliased to 'el' and using this alias is recommended as it saves space:
    #
    #  el(:first_name) { |b| b.text_field(:id 'signup-first-name') }
    def element(name, &block)
      @page_elements ||= []

    end
    alias :el :element

    # Allows you to set special page attributes that affect page behavior. The two page
    # attributes currently supported are :navigation_disabled and :page_template:
    #
    # * When :navigation_disabled is specified as a page attribute, all automatic and
    #   manual browser navigation is disabled. If you call the page's page methods
    #   automatic navigation is turned off -- it won't automatically load the page for
    #   you. And it the method will raise a PageNavigationNotAllowedError if you call
    #   the page's accessor method while you aren't actually on the page. And finally,
    #   the page's visit method is disabled. This attribute is useful only when you
    #   have a page that can't be automatically navigated to, in which case all of
    #   the navigation features described above wouldn't work anyway.
    #
    # * When :page_template is specified as a page attribute, the site object won't
    #   create an accessor method for the page when initializing and also won't include
    #   the page when calling the site object's pages method. This allows you to define
    #   a page object for inheritance purposes only. The idea behind this is to put common
    #   features one or more of these templates, which won't get used directly. Then your
    #   other page objects that you actually do want to use can inherit from one of the
    #   templates, gaining all of its features. For example, you can put things like a
    #   logout link or common menus into a template and then have all of the page objects
    #   that need those features inherit from the template and get those features
    #   automatically.
    #

    # Used to define the full or relative URL to the page. Typically, you will *almost* *always* want to use
    # this method when defining a page object (but see notes below.) The URL can be defined in a number
    # of different ways. Here are some examples using Google News:
    #
    # *Relative* *URL*
    #
    #  set_url "/nwshp?hl=en"
    #
    # Relative URLs are most commonly used when defining page objects. The idea here is that you can
    # change the base_url when calling the site object, which allows you to use the same code across
    # multiple test environments by changing the base_url as you initialize a site object.
    #
    # *Relative* *URL* *with* *URL* *Templating*
    #  set_url "/nwshp?hl={language}"
    #
    # This takes the relative URL example one step further, allowing you to set the page's parameters.
    # Note that the the language specified in the first relative URL example ('en') was replaced by
    # '{language}' in this one. Siteobject uses the Addressable library, which supports this kind of
    # templating. When you template a value in the URL, the page object will allow you to specify the
    # templated value when it's being initialized. Here's an example of how this works using a news site.
    # Here's the base site object class:
    #
    #  class NewsSite
    #    include SiteObject
    #  end
    #
    # Here's a page object for the news page, templating the language value in the URL:
    #
    #  class NewsPage < NewsSite::Page
    #    set_url "/news?l={language}"
    #  end
    #
    # After you've initialized the site object you can load the Spanish or French versions of the
    # page by changing the hash argument used to call the page from the site object:
    #
    #  site = NewsSite.new(base_url: "http://news.somesite.com")
    #  site.news_page(language: 'es')
    #  site.news_page(language: 'fr')
    #
    # In addition to providing a hash of templated values when initializing a page you can also use
    # an object, as long as that object responds to all of the templated arguments in the page's
    # URL definition. Here's a simple class that has a language method that we can use for the news
    # page described above:
    #
    #  class Country
    #    attr_reader :language
    #
    #    def initialize(lang)
    #      @language = lang
    #    end
    #  end
    #
    # In the example below, the Country class is used to create a new new country object called 'c'.
    # This object has been initialized with a Spanish language code and the news page
    # will load the spanish version of the page when it's called with the country object.
    #
    #  site = NewsSite.new(base_url: "http://news.somesite.com")
    #  c = Country.new('es')
    #  => <Country:0x007fcb0dc67f98 @language="es">
    #  c.language
    #  => 'es'
    #  site.news_page(c)
    #  => <NewsPage:0x003434546566>
    #
    # If one or more URL parameters are missing when the page is getting initialized then the page
    # will look at the hash arguments used to initialize the site. If the argument the page needs is
    # defined in the site's initialization arguments it will use that. For example, if the site
    # object is initialized with a port, subdomain, or any other argument you can use those values
    # when defining a page URL. Example:
    #
    #  class ConfigPage < MySite::Page
    #    set_url "/foo/{subdomain}/config"
    #  end
    #
    #  site = MySite.new(subdomain: 'foo')
    #  => <MySite:0x005434546511>
    #  site.configuration_page # No need to provide a subdomain here as long as the site object has it.
    #  => <ConfigPage:0x705434546541>
    #
    # *Full* *URL*
    #  set_url "http://news.google.com/nwshp?hl=en"
    #
    # Every once in a while you may not want to use a base URL that has been defined. This allows you
    # to do that. Just define a complete URL for that page object and that's what will get used; the
    # base_url will be ignored.
    #
    # *No* *URL*
    #
    # The set_url method is not mandatory. when defining a page. If you don't use set_url in the page
    # definition then the page will defined the base_url as the page's URL.
    def set_url(url)
      url ? @page_url = url : nil

    # happens the regular expression defined here will be applied and the navigation check will pass
    # if the regular expression matches the current browser URL.

    # If a match occurs here, and there are no required arguments for the page the method returns true.
    # If the page's URL template does require arguments the method performs an additional check to
